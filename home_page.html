    <h4>How is English Football Structured?</h4>
    <p>Unlike American sports leagues, English football is set up as a pyramid with levels. Each year, the best performing teams are promoted to the next best level for next season, and the worst performing teams are relegated(demoted) a level lower on the pyramid. The English football pyramid is the largest in Europe with over 5,000 clubs participating and 21 levels. The top four levels are known as "league football," and its players are considered professional.</p>

    <h4>The Top 4 Levels of English Football</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Premier League</li>
        <li>EFL Championship</li>
        <li>EFL League One</li>
        <li>EFL League Two</li>
    </ol>
